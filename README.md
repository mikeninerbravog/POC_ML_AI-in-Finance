# AI in Finance - Proof of Concept (PoC)

## Overview
This repository contains a **Proof of Concept (PoC)** for AI applications in finance, developed by **Mike Niner Bravog**. The PoC demonstrates:

1. **Fraud Detection:** Using *Isolation Forest* to identify suspicious transactions.
2. **Market Trend Prediction:** Applying *Linear Regression* to predict future market trends.
3. **Financial Chatbot:** A simple chatbot that answers basic financial questions (expandable into a fully autonomous assistant).

## Installation
To run this PoC locally, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## Running the Code
Execute the Python script to see fraud detection, market trend predictions, and chatbot responses:

```bash
python ai_finance_poc.py
```

## Google Colab
The code is also available as a **Google Colab Notebook** for easy execution without local setup:
