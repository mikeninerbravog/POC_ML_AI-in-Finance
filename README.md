# AI in Finance - Proof of Concept (PoC)

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mikeninerbravog/POC_ML_AI-in-Finance/blob/master/POC_ML_FraudDetection.ipynb)

## Overview
This repository contains a **Proof of Concept (PoC)** for AI applications in finance, developed by **Mike Niner Bravog**. The PoC demonstrates:

1. **Fraud Detection:** Using *Isolation Forest* to identify suspicious transactions.
2. **Market Trend Prediction:** Applying *Linear Regression* to predict future market trends.
3. **Financial Chatbot:** A simple chatbot that answers basic financial questions (expandable into a fully autonomous assistant).

## What is PoC?
### ... and Why so important for both the Programmer and the Customer

A **Proof of Concept (PoC)** is an initial, controlled implementation created to validate ideas, assumptions, and technical feasibility before committing to a full-scale system. It benefits both the programmer and the client by providing early evidence that a solution is possible, identifying risks upfront, and establishing a shared technical understanding. A PoC allows ideas to move from concept to reality through small, modular experiments, in which each stage is tested in isolation and advanced only after it has been validated and approved by both the programmer and the client. This incremental approach reduces uncertainty, prevents premature complexity, and creates a solid foundation for evolving the codebase into a complete, production-ready system.


## Installation
To run this PoC locally, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## Running the Code
Execute the Python script to see fraud detection, market trend predictions, and chatbot responses:

```bash
python ai_finance_poc.py
```

## Google Colab
The code is also available as a **Google Colab Notebook** for easy execution without local setup:
