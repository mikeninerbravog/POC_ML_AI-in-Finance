        "#### **1. Fraud Detection and Valid Transactions**\n",
        "The function `detect_transactions()` simulates financial transactions and applies **Isolation Forest**, an anomaly-based machine learning model, to classify them as **fraudulent (-1)** or **valid (1)**.\n",
        "\n",

        "##### **Results**\n",
        "- **Fraudulent Transactions Detected**: Transactions **500, 600, 750, and 1000** were identified as fraudulent because they are significantly **higher than the average transaction value (100)**, making them outliers.\n",
        "- Some additional values (**137.04 and 47.60**) were also flagged as fraudulent, possibly due to being at the extreme ends of the distribution.\n",
        "- **Valid Transactions**: The rest of the transactions, which are closer to the normal range (mean = 100, std = 20), were classified as legitimate.\n",
